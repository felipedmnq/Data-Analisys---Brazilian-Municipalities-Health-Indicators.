# Data Analisys - Brazilian Municipalities Health Indicators.
***First analysis project***.

This is my first data analysis project, I'm learning for a few weeks and I decided to test my skills.
This project is more about data preparation, since I still haven't learned much about data visualization.

Update - project close.

This was my first data analysis project. 
I tried to pickup a DataSet related with my current work field - water treatment and sanitation - but this DataSet has no further information about the variables and it makes more dificult to get some conclusion, and adding to that my lack of experience with data analysis, 
made the project unfeasible.
But not everything was bad, this was only my first project of many future, I got training, experience, I had my data analysis skill improved and a lot of fun.
